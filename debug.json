      "content": "<state_snapshot>\n    <overall_goal>\n        Fix bugs related to using OpenAI-compatible models with the Gemini CLI, specifically ensuring that tool calls work correctly when resuming a session from a checkpoint file.\n    </overall_goal>\n\n    <key_knowledge>\n        - The primary issue occurs when using the `--resume` flag, indicating a problem with how the saved chat history is loaded and processed. Fresh sessions work correctly.\n        - The OpenAI API requires a strict `assistant` message with `tool_calls` to be immediately followed by a `tool` message with the results. The IDs must match.\n        - The `toGeminiRequest` function in `openai-converters.ts` is responsible for converting the CLI's internal history format to the OpenAI format.\n        - Analysis of a `debug.json` log revealed that the API was returning a `400 Bad Request` error because the `arguments` field in a `tool_calls` object was being sent as an empty object (`{}`) instead of a stringified empty object (`'{}'`).\n        - A secondary bug was identified in the `checkNextSpeaker` function, which was not using the OpenAI conversion logic, causing it to send malformed requests.\n        - A tertiary bug was found where OpenAI's \"JSON Mode\" was not being enabled for requests that required a JSON response, causing parsing errors.\n    </key_knowledge>\n\n    <file_system_state>\n        - CWD: `/mnt/c/code/gemini-cli-hooks`\n        - READ: `debug.json` - Crucial for diagnosing the `400` error. It showed the exact malformed request payload, specifically the un-stringified `arguments` object.\n        - All recent changes to `openai-converters.ts`, `geminiChat.ts`, `client.ts`, and `nextSpeakerChecker.ts` have been reverted via `git reset --hard` to start the debugging process over with the new insights.\n    </file_system_state>\n\n    <recent_actions>\n        - A series of fixes were attempted, committed, and pushed to address tool call issues.\n        - The user discovered that the issue was specific to the `--resume` flag.\n        - The user ran the CLI with debug flags, redirecting the output to `debug.json` to capture the failing API request.\n        - We analyzed the `debug.json` file and identified the root cause of the `400` error: the `arguments` field was not being correctly stringified.\n        - Based on this new, clearer understanding of the problem, the user requested to revert all previous changes to start with a clean slate.\n        - The command `git reset --hard` was run, reverting the repository to the last known good commit.\n    </recent_actions>\n\n    <current_plan>\n        1.  [TODO] Re-implement the fix in `openai-converters.ts` to correctly handle the conversion of the chat history, making it robust enough to handle imperfections from resumed sessions.\n        2.  [TODO] Specifically, ensure that when a mock `assistant` message is created for backward compatibility, its `arguments` field is correctly stringified (i.e., `JSON.stringify({})`).\n        3.  [TODO] Re-apply the fixes to the `checkNextSpeaker` function to ensure it uses the corrected OpenAI conversion logic.\n        4.  [TODO] Re-apply the fix to enable OpenAI's \"JSON Mode\" when a JSON response is required.\n        5.  [TODO] Build and test the complete solution, focusing on validating the `--resume` workflow.\n        6.  [TODO] Commit and push the final, correct changes.\n    </current_plan>\n</state_snapshot>"

The error message \\\\\\\"Failed to parse API response as JSON: Unexpected token 'H', \\\\\\\"Hi there! \\\\\\\"... is not valid JSON\\\\\\\" is the key.\\\\n\\\\nThis means that when `checkNextSpeaker` asked the model for a JSON response, the model ignored the instructions and replied with a conversational \\\\\\\"Hi there!\\\\\\\". This is a common issue when a model isn't strictly forced into a specific output format.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem is that while my previous fix correctly formatted the *content* of the request for the OpenAI API, it didn't enable OpenAI's specific **JSON Mode**.

Thank you.\\\\n\\\\nYour analysis is almost certainly correct. The fact that it works correctly in a fresh session but fails with `--resume` points directly to an issue with how the chat history is being saved, loaded, and then interpreted.\\\\n\\\\nThe conversion logic we wrote is brittle. It assumes a perfect, uninterrupted sequence of `model` (`functionCall`) -> `user` (`functionResponse`) turns. When you resume a session, the history is loaded from the checkpoint file, and it's likely that this loaded history has slight imperfections (like the empty `parts: []` we saw before, or other structural differences) that break the converter's fragile assumptions.\\\\n\\\\nThe `400 Provider returned error` is the smoking gun. It means we are sending a malformed request, which happens when the converter creates an invalid sequence of messages (like a `tool` message without a preceding `assistant` message) because it couldn't find the `functionCall` in the *exact* place it expected.\\\\n\\\\nI will now implement a much more robust version of the OpenAI conversion logic.\\\\n\\\\n**My Plan:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Modify `toGeminiRequest`:** I will rewrite the loop in `packages/core/src/utils/openai-converters.ts`.\\\\n2.  **New Robust Logic:**\\\\n    *   When the loop encounters a `user` message containing a `functionResponse`, it will no longer just look at the immediately preceding message.\\\\n    *   Instead, it will **search backwards** from that point in the history to find the most recent `model` turn that contains the matching `functionCall`.\\\\n    *   This makes the logic resilient to any extra or empty turns that might exist in the checkpoint file from previous buggy versions. It will find the correct `functionCall` regardless of its exact position, as long as it occurred before the `functionResponse`.\\\\n    *   I will also re-implement the JSON mode fix to address the second error you saw.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach directly addresses the fragility of the history proce...

It is primarily designed for text-based files. However, it can also process image (e.g., .png, .jpg) and PDF (.pdf) files if their file names or extensions are explicitly included in the 'paths' argument. For these explicitly requested non-text files, their data is read and included in a format suitable for model consumption (e.g., base64 encoded).\n\nThis tool is useful when you need to understand or analyze a collection of files, such as:\n- Getting an overview of a codebase or parts of it (e.g., all TypeScript files in the 'src' directory).\n- Finding where specific functionality is implemented if the user asks broad questions about code.\n- Reviewing documentation files (e.g., all Markdown files in the 'docs' directory).\n- Gathering context from multiple configuration files.\n- When the user asks to \"read all files in X directory\" or \"show me the content of all Y files\".\n\nUse this tool when the user's query implies needing the content of several files simultaneously for context, analysis, or summarization. For text files, it uses default UTF-8 encoding and a '--- {filePath} ---' separator between file contents. Ensure paths are relative to the target directory. Glob patterns like 'src/**/*.js' are supported. Avoid using for single files if a more specific single-file reading tool is available, unless the user specifically requests to process a list containing just one file via this tool. Other binary files (not explicitly requested as image/PDF) are generally skipped.
